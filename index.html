            <p> Hi! I am Sheldon Cooper. I am  a fictional character in the CBS television series The Big Bang Theory . I am  a senior theoretical physicist at The California Institute of Technology (Caltech). Sorry to say, I have a fundamental lack of social skills, a tenuous understanding of humor, and difficulty recognizing irony and sarcasm in other people.  </p>
            <p>I have no enemy and have many friends. Haha. <span class="bazinga">Bazinga!</span></p>
